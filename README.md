## iOS - Application

We build a native iOS app and used ARKit and CoreML.

Core ML (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) is used for the image detection in combination with a cloud back-up if the detection is to slow.

ARKit (https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) is used to display the 3D car models. The car modelc can be updated in realtime.

## AMAG API

We used the AMAG API to get data from from the different vehicles, which are currently avaibale. If a user add a new vehicle we creat a new uquice ID and can than add different configurations for that car. We request the pricing for the current configurations and can thereby calculate the duration it would take to finance that specific car.

## Credit Suisse API

We created a new user on the Credit Suisse API and added a new customer. We added a KYC and can now request the banking information via the "SearchByName" endpoint. We get the usertype, which in our case is a student. We also get the anual income, anual spending, marital status, total wealth, number of kids and number of car. This data is used inside the app to calculate the money the user has to pay monthly to get the car financed. The user also see's how he does compared to his peers and what impact his financial decision has. 

## Business

In the business folder you find the slide deck for the pitch presentation at Hack Zurich. We keept that really short as we think a demo is much better than just power point slides.
